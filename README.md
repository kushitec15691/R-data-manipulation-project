# 📊 R Data Manipulation Project – Kushmi Anuththara Chandrasena

This project is part of a university lab assignment focused on using **base R** for data analysis and manipulation. It involves solving statistical and logical problems through R scripting, working with datasets, creating summaries, exporting results, and performing structured analysis.

---

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project contains solutions to various R lab exercises including:
- Vector operations and filtering
- Creating data frames and writing CSV files
- Reading datasets and performing exploratory data analysis
- Statistical summaries and conditional filtering
- Application of R logic on real-world data (e.g., gender wage gaps, urban stats)

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `r-data-manipulation-project.R`  | ✅ Main R script with all code for Questions 1–4 |
| `Freedman.csv`                   | Dataset used for Question 3 analysis |
| `avg_wage_data.csv`              | Output CSV created from custom wage dataframe |
| `r_lab_assignment(2).pdf`        | Assignment document outlining each question |
| `R submission confirmation.txt`  | (Optional) Submission proof from university portal |

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Logical indexing and vector filtering
- Data frame creation and manipulation
- Exporting data using `write.csv()`
- Exploratory analysis on CSV datasets using:
  - `mean()`, `summary()`, `nrow()`, and indexing
- Practical application using real datasets (Freedman urban dataset)

---

## 📦 Packages Used
- No external packages required  
(Only **base R** used for all logic and data handling)
